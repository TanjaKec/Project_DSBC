## Problem 1

Write a short R Markdown report to explore `nez-opendata_02_19.csv` dataset download from [Serbian Open Data portal](https://data.gov.rs/sr/datasets/podatsi-o-saobratshajnim-nezgodama-za-teritoriju-grada-beograda/). This data contains the information about traffic accidents at the territory of the City of Belgrade for the period from January, 01 until February 28, 2019.

In the traffic_accidents_19_BG. R script file this data has been organised for further data wrangling necessary for addressing the problems listed below. 

Note that there are

-	three kind of accidents (variable ` accident`): 
  *	material_demage
  *	deaths and 
  *	injured 
-	five different types of accident (variable ` type_acc`):
  *	one_vehicle
  *	two_vehicle_no_turn 
  *	two_vehicle 
  *	parked_vehicle 
  *	pedestrian         

I) Use appropriate visualisation to present your findings for the following tasks:

  1)	Which kind of the accident is the most frequent?
  2)	Which day in the week has the highest number of accidents?
  3)	For each day in the week find the total number of each kind of accidents
  4)	Identify time in the day (the hour) with the highest number of accidents
  5)	What is the most occurring type of the accident during the hour with the highest number of accidents?

II) Creat a ` leafleta` interactive map to pinpoint the accidents with the popup message of the description of the accidents. This popup message should appear every time user click on an accident marker.

Tips: for manipulating date-time type of data you might find useful using the [tidyverse]( https://www.tidyverse.org) package [`lubridate`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org). You might also find useful the check data analysis report about air pollution in Belgrade available from: https://tanjakec.github.io/OH_workshop/OHSA.html
